> ## Prerequisites
>
> This tutorial complements and in parts extends [EIC Tutorial: Geometry development using DD4hep](https://github.com/eic/tutorial-geometry-development-using-dd4hep) and has the same basic requirements. Material from that tutorial is helpful but not needed.
It also in part excerpts the very comprehensive [drich-dev tutorial series](https://github.com/eic/drich-dev/blob/main/doc/tutorials/README.md), which should for now be considered further reading until its materials are also incorporated into this tutorial series
